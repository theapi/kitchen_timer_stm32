 * Address can be one of 15 ( a 4 bit number) addresses.
 * So the data gets saved in 15 different locations,
 * meaning 15 times the normal wear, 150,000 saves instead of 10,000.
 * 1 save a day ~= 411 years
 * 10 saves a day _= 41 years
 * 100 saves a day _= 4 years
 * Should be enough :)
 *
 * So with this each data needs 15 words.
 * The counter is kept in the word previous to the data word, so that's another 15 words.
 * In total the data with it's counter needs 30 words.
 * 30 words for 1 word, we only save a byte, so 30 words for 1 byte!!!
 *
 * EEPROM memory is then:
 * counter | data | counter | data etc...
 *
 * Flash Data EEPROM can hold 2 Kbytes
 *
 * The way it works:
 * - Each save, add 1 to the counter.
 * - Use the counter_address of (id * (32*4)) + (least significant 4 bits of the counter * 8).
 * then the data address is counter_address + 4
 *
 * eg.
 * - First save of data id 0:
 *  id = 0, counter = 0, address = 0 + 0b0000 = 0 + (0 * 8) = 0
 * - Second save:
 *  id = 0, counter = 1, address = 0 + 0b0001 = 0 + (1 * 8) = 8
 * - 15th save:
 *  id = 0, counter = 15, address = 0 + 0b1111 = 0 + (15 * 8) = 120
 * - 123456th save:
 * id = 0, counter = 123456, address = 0 + 0b0000 = 0 + (0 * 8) = 0
 * - 856473564th save:
 * id = 0, counter = 856473564, address = 0 + 0b1100 = 0 + (12 * 8) = 96
 *
 * - First save of data id 1:
 *  id = 1, counter = 0, address = (1 * 128) + 0b0000 = 128 + (0 * 8) = 128
 * - Second save:
 *  id = 1, counter = 1, address = (1 * 128) + 0b0001 = 128 + (1 * 8) = 136
 * - 15th save:
 *  id = 1, counter = 15, address = (1 * 128) + 0b1111 = 128 + (15 * 8) = 248
 * - 123456th save:
 *  id = 1, counter = 123456, address = (1 * 128) + 0b0000 = 128 + (0 * 8) = 128
 * - 856473564th save:
 *  id = 0, counter = 856473564, address = (1 * 128) + 0b1100 = 128 + (12 * 8) = 224
 *
 *  - First save of data id 2:
 *  id = 2, counter = 0, address = (2 * 128) + 0b0000 = 128 + (0 * 4) = 256
